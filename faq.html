          <h3>4. Do I need to download all parts before extracting and why big games on ApunKaGames are in parts?</h3>
          <p><b>Ans.</b> First of all, yes you need to download all parts. In case you will not download all parts then it won't have all the game data files that are required to extract the game resulting in corrupt file error. The reason we upload big games in parts is to assure that users can easily download them quickly. If big games are not divided into parts, downloading will take a lot of time.</p>
